UDP Datagram Loss Estimator:

(for all test we used an amount of 1000 packages and a interval of 2ms)

1. Localhost (local machine)

On average we had 3% datagram losses with packages sized to 10k bytes.

2. Ethernet (Both being connected via cable at ITU)

On average we had 1% datagram losses with packages sized to 10k bytes.

3. WiFi (both being connected to Eduroam @ ITU)

Surprisingly WiFi were pretty stable. On average we lost around 1-2 datagrams, which resulted in 0% datagram losses with packages sized to 10k bytes (perhaps the fact that we did our tests late sunday have an impact)

4. Internet

On average we had 7-8% datagram losses with packages sized to 10k bytes. The results were pretty different, which is kindda expected.

Conclusion:

Higher intervals and lower package size results in less datagram loss. On the other hand, it seems that WiFi is "stronger" than localhost,
which makes no sense.
