We spent a lot of time trying to figure out the sinks.
The sources and controller was completed rather fast (2-3 hours), but we ended up spending approx. 7 hours
on figuring out how to handle the sinks. Which we never managed. We believe that if we had solved the TCPForwarder in the first mini-project, then this would have come easy.

We will be looking into this in our fall break. Some hints would be most welcome, if any can be given :)

Thanks!
